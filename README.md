# SPL Token Helper Crate

**Status:** 🚧 Under Development 🚧

This crate aims to simplify the process of creating SPL tokens on the Solana blockchain by providing a user-friendly abstraction layer. While our primary goal is to streamline the token creation process, we also offer features to allow manual setup for advanced users.

## Features (Planned)

- **Easy SPL Token Creation:** Quickly create and manage SPL tokens with minimal setup.
- **Manual Setup Options:** For advanced users, detailed control and configuration of token parameters.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Well-documented code and a modular approach for easy integration.
